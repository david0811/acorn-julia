These notebooks develop the neural network (NN) model to predict zonal load in the NYISO region. The NN model roughly follows [Doering et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ooenergy/oiad003). To predict hourly zonal load, we use hour of the day, day of the year, hourly temperature, and the previous two days' average temperature as features. The model predicts load across all zones concurrently, and effectively captures cross-zone correlation.
