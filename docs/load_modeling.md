# Load modeling

We model three distinct load sources -- ``baseline" load from historical NYISO data, plus potential future load increases due to electrification of residential and commerical buildings. All are modeled as a function of temperature — baseline load at the zonal level and Res/Com-Stock state-wide. Baseline load is disaggregated to the bus level using the historical load ratios from the original 140-bus NPCC system. Res/Com-Stock data is first disaggregated to the county level using NREL building weight files. Then to disaggregate to the bus level, the load is distributed evenly for counties with one or more buses, and the loads for counties without a bus is distributed to the nearest single bus. Note that only buses with non-zero load ratio based on the NPCC system are considered. Note also that NREL provides many possible electrification upgrades for both residential and commerical buildings, so we need to choose one of each for the ACORN runs — the defaults are upgrade 1 for ResStock (ENERGY STAR heat pump with elec backup) and upgrade 31 (Package 3 - Wall and Roof Insulation, New Windows, LED Lighting and ASHP-Boiler) for ComStock. Note that the ResStock load is much larger than ComStock.
